        <h1>About EcoTrack</h1>
        <p>
          EcoTrack is a community-driven initiative to promote awareness about sustainable waste
          management. The project aims to bridge the gap between citizens and local authorities by
          providing a digital platform for reporting waste issues and spreading knowledge about
          recycling, composting, and smart city initiatives.
        </p>

        <h2>🌍 Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          To create a cleaner, greener, and smarter city by combining technology, awareness, and
          citizen participation.
        </p>

        <h2>🏙️ Smart Waste Management System</h2>
        <p>
          In smart cities like Ahmednagar, waste management departments use digital dashboards,
          IoT-enabled sensors, and GPS-tracked collection vehicles to monitor and optimize the
          collection process. By integrating data and awareness, cities aim to reduce landfill waste
          and improve recycling efficiency.

            <h3>Dry Waste</h3>
            <p>Paper, plastic, glass, and metal. Keep them clean and dry for recycling.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="guide-card">
            <h3>Wet Waste</h3>
            <p>Kitchen waste, vegetable peels, and garden waste. Ideal for composting.</p>

          <div class="guide-card">
            <h3>Hazardous Waste</h3>
            <p>Batteries, e-waste, chemicals, and paints. Dispose at authorized centers.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>💬 Citizen’s Role</h2>
        <p>
          Every citizen plays a key role in maintaining cleanliness. By segregating waste at home,
          participating in awareness drives, and reporting unattended waste, we can build a cleaner
          city together.
